            <h1>Safety & Security</h1>
            <p>At AdventureQuest Kids, your child's safety is our top priority. Every aspect of our program has been designed to ensure a safe, engaging, and memorable experience for all participants. From our strict LARP safety protocols to our highly trained staff, we’ve implemented comprehensive safety measures to give you peace of mind.</p>

            <!-- LARP Safety Protocols Section -->
            <section class="boxed-section">
                <h2>LARP Safety Protocols</h2>
                <p>We take every precaution to ensure that all LARP activities are safe for every participant. Our foam weaponry is specifically designed for safe, soft-contact use, and every weapon is inspected before each adventure. Here’s how we make sure combat and non-combat roles are equally safe:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Foam Weapon Checks:</strong> All foam swords, shields, and spell balls are thoroughly checked for any damage before each use. We ensure that the materials are soft, flexible, and safe for children of all ages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combat Safety Guidelines:</strong> During combat scenarios, children are instructed on proper fighting techniques that emphasize controlled, light strikes. There is no striking above the shoulders or at sensitive areas like the groin. Children are trained to respect each other and abide by the rules of engagement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Combat Roles:</strong> For children who prefer not to engage in combat, we offer roles like medics, strategists, or messengers. These roles allow children to fully participate in the adventure while avoiding direct physical activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supervised Combat:</strong> All combat activities are supervised by staff members who ensure that combat remains safe, fun, and non-aggressive.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
